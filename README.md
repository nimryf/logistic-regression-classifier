# Binary Logistic Regression classifier

Distinguishes between two classes: 1s and 0s.

- This classifier was made from scratch and does not use have any dependencies.
- Training uses a provided dataset as input and returns a fitted model, which stores the model parameters found by training.
- The fitted model is then used to classify observations.
- The model was used to classify the same training set, with a classification accuracy of 93.36%.

I found the following two links to be highly useful in understanding and coding this.

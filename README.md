Distinguishes between two classes: 1s and 0s.

- Training uses a provided dataset as input and returns a fitted model, which stores the model parameters found by training.
- The fitted model is then used to classify observations.
- The model was used to classify the same training set, with a classification accuracy of 93.36%.

The following two links proved highly useful in understanding and coding this kind of classifier.

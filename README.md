# Binary Logistic Regression classifier

Distinguishes between two classes: 1s and 0s.

- This classifier was made from scratch and does not use have any dependencies.
- Training uses a provided dataset as input and returns a fitted model, which stores the model parameters found by training.
- The fitted model is then used to classify observations.
- A function that measures accuracy is included.
- The model was used to classify the same training set, with a classification accuracy of 93.36%.

I found these [two](http://kenzotakahashi.github.io/logistic-regression-from-scratch-in-python.html) [links](https://medium.com/@martinpella/logistic-regression-from-scratch-in-python-124c5636b8ac) to be highly useful in understanding and coding this.

# Setup and use

- Simply download Python and the IDE of choice. 
- Function example_use() shows how to use the classifier, and also tests its accuracy.
